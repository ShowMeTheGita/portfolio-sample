# Sample Portfolio-style Website

[Website](https://showmethegita.github.io/portfolio-sample/)

Portfolio-like website created to practice **HTML structuring, CSS Grid and Flexbox.**

### Why?

Much like my other [static webpage project](https://github.com/ShowMeTheGita/codfish-paradise-inc) Readme says, I took this project on to better understand the concepts stated above before starting a journey through React.

This website was created by doing a follow-along [Udemy tutorial](https://youtu.be/5bMdjkfvONE?list=PLHxXwbOHJMWnBucDyRqvlYYUSgFt4EKMI) taught by [Jordan Hudgens](https://github.com/jordanhudgens) so a big thanks to him for the free practice material!
